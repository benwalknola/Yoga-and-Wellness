                    <h3>How do I start Meditation?</h3>
                    <p>At Yoga and Wellness the only objective in our meditations is for you to let go of control. When most people begin to meditate they attempt to concentrate as hard as they can on stopping their thoughts, which is a losing battle. Instead, at Yoga and Wellness, the only thing we recommend that you do is to completely let go of control and to observe your thoughts for what they are in the present moment.. The more you try to manipulate your experience the further you get from a productive meditation session</p>
